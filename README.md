A flake8 extension to validate django models ForeignKey fields
on on_delete CASCADE comment.

```python
test_field = models.ForeignKey(  # allowed_cascade
    'TestModel',
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
)
```

CASCADE can be not safe to choose, so such fields should be marked by comment.

## Installation

```terminal
pip install flake8-django-on-delete-comment
```

## Example

Sample file:

```python
# test.py

first_field = models.ForeignKey(  # allowed_cascade
    'FirstModel',
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
)

second_field = models.ForeignKey(
    'SecondModel',
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
)

third_field = models.ForeignKey(
    'ThirdModel',
    on_delete=models.PROTECT,
)
```

Usage:

```terminal
$ flake8 test.py
test.py:6:1: CD001 field needs a valid comment for on_delete
```
